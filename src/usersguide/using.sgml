<title>Using CADD Roll</title>

<para>
The CADD roll deployes several web services on your frontend machine. To see a live 
list of web services available on your machine you can point your browser at 
<ulink url="http://servername/opal2/dashboard?command=serviceList">
http://servername/opal2/dashboard?command=serviceList</ulink>, if you click on one of the 
available serivces you can also access a web based submission form.
Below it is reported a list of services deployed by the CADD roll.
</para>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem><para>Gromos Cluster 4.5.5: RMSD-based clustering algorithm developed within Gromos</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>TrajQR: QR factorization (or structure QR) using VMD</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Prepare Receptor 1.5.6: Prepare a pdb file to be used by Vina for Virtual Screening</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Vina Screening 1.1.2: Run a virtual screening using Vina Autodock</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>To use the Vision based pipeline you should type 
<command>cadd</command> at your prompt. When the application 
loads on the top of the windows you can select the pipeline you 
want to load for execution. The top menu Virtual Screening contains 
the VinaVSPublic which allows users to run a Vina Virtual Screening, 
using available libraries on the server.
The other two abailable workflow are in the MD Analysis section, Gromos clustering
and TrajQR.</para>


<para>The CADD roll makes also available on the cluster several libraries of ligands,
which can be selected for performing virtual screening:</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>NCI_DS3: NCI Diversity Set 3. Prepared 2012. Contains ?? compounds. </para></listitem>
<listitem><para>NCIDS_SC: NCI Diversity Set 1 with rotamers. Prepared 2006 - 2007. Uses ZINC naming scheme. Contains 2282 compounds.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>sample: debugging library with only 6 ligand that can be used for testing purposes</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>


<para>To add additional libraries the user must copy new libraries in the directory 
<command>/state/partition1/opal/libraries</command>
on the frontend node, and they will be available to all the cluster via NFS.

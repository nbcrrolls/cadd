<title>Using the EC2 CADD Amazon Machine Images (AMI)</title>

<para>
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that 
provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. 
EC2 allows users to rent virtual computers on which to run their 
own computer applications. 
</para>

<para>
To allow usage of the CADD pipeline with minimal effort we developed a virtual machine 
inside Amazon EC2 (commonly called AMI), that can be used to perform virtual screening using EC2
infrastructure (no need to use local hardware or to perform any complex installation).
</para>

<section id="ec1-ami" xreflabel="Using CADD AMI">
<title>Using Amazon AMI</title>

<para>
To use the CADD Amazon AMI a user must create an account with 
<ulink url="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon AWS</ulink> providing its credit 
card number. Then he/she should login with the 
<ulink url="https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home">Amazon Console</ulink>
and go to the EC2 section. Click on Images -> AMIs, select "All Images" from 
the Viewing drop down box, and in the search box type "si2012". You should see 
only one item left in the list called "si2012-opal/image.manifest.xml", 
right click on it and select "Launch Instance". See image below.</para>

<para>In the first dialog you should choose the machine size you like to use for 
your docking (see the table in the next section for pricing and execution duration). 
</para>

<para>Just make sure that your default security group allow http traffic from your IP 
address to you Amazon Virtual Machine.
Wait 10 minute for the machine to properly boot and then connect your 
CADD client replacying the host name with the host name assigned to the machine 
you just booted (you can see that in the "Instances" section).
</para>

<section id="user-libraries" xreflabel="User Defined Libraries">
<title>User Defined Libraries</title>
<para>If you want to run the CADD pipeline against your defined libraries of 
ligands, you can place them inside an <ulink url="http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/">
Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)</ulink> volume.</para>

<para>After that when you launch your machine at the Advanced Instance Options diaglog 
you should type in the "library &lt;devicename&gt; &lt;path/to/libraries&gt;" in the User Data
field as show in the picture.
</para>

</mediaobject>


<para>
The &lt;devicename&gt; should be the device specified when the volume will be attached 
to the instance (we recomend using "sdp" and specifying /dev/sdp when attaching the volume).
While &lt;path/to/libraries&gt; should be the asolute path name where the library are placed 
in the EBS volume. If you have a EBS with two libraries in myLibraries/lib1 and myLibraries/lib2
you should specify myLibraries.
</para>
<para>
After the machine boot it will wait for the device &lt;devicename&gt; specified to appear and 
then it will mount it and configure the pipeline to use libraries stored on that volume.
</para>

<para>To attach the volume to your running instance you should go to the EC2, Elastic Block
Store, Volumes select the volumes you would like to attach, right click on it and select 
"Attach Volume". In the dialog you should select the instance you just booted and in the device 
field type "/deb/sdp". Wait 5 minute and then your instance is ready to dock against your customized
library.
</para>

<title>Execution Time</title>
<para>Using the included NCI Diversity Set 3 library we run some screening using EC2 
instances and we obtained the following execution time using the default Vina settings.
It is clear that the most convenient EC2 instance type to use for screening is the m1.xlarge
considering that it has a shorter execution time and it ends up being cheaper.
